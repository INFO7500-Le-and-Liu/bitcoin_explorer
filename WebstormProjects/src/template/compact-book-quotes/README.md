# Compact book quotes

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/lalacode/pen/dydxxxe](https://codepen.io/lalacode/pen/dydxxxe).

I started to save some memorable quotes after reading a book some time ago.

So there is a design by Matt Willey (Art director of the New York Times btw) that I found here: https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/thanks-nsw01-compressed-headlines-have-never-looked-better-typetuesday/

First book was bugged for some reason (width wasn't explicitly defined), and it was wider by 1px, which I haven't understood yet (DONE)
Tip: quote \<q> tag defers from regular \<p> paragraph in dimensions, but I wasn't quite expecting that.
Sliding animation is kinda nice, I was inspired by my roommate whom I helped to create similar sliding element, so props to him!
Pages numbers are kinda random, don't know what to do with them...

Code is static (TODO), but tailwind becomes more and more familiar as I do more projects like this.
